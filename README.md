# Distributed Optimal Transport Library
This repository contains basic scripts for computing Wasserstein distances.
The long term objective is to develop Distributed Optimal Transport Algorithms.

The project is just started and at the moment containes only python scripts to test the distances 
between pair of images of the [DOTMark benchmarks](http://www.stochastik.math.uni-goettingen.de/index.php?id=215/).

To run the scripts you need the followinf libraries:

* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) (python)
* [NetworkX](http://networkx.github.io/) (python)
* [Gurobi](http://www.gurobi.com)
