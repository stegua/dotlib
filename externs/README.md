# External Libraries
This folder contains the external libraries used by DOTLib.

As a policy, we used header only libraries.

Currently, the external libraries are:

1. [Taywee/args](https://github.com/Taywee/args) as a argument parser library

2. [Yocta Logger](https://github/stegua/yocta) as a Logger library
